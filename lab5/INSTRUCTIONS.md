\# Lab 3.1 — Event-Driven Cybersecurity Pipeline with Kafka and Tracing



\## Overview



In this laboratory assignment, you will build and explore a \*\*simplified cybersecurity analysis pipeline\*\* based on \*\*event streaming and asynchronous processing\*\*.



The goal of this lab is \*\*not\*\* to train advanced machine learning models, but to help you understand:



\* how \*\*high-load cybersecurity pipelines\*\* are constructed,

\* why \*\*message queues\*\* (Kafka) are used instead of direct function calls,

\* how \*\*pipeline stages are decoupled\*\*,

\* and how \*\*distributed tracing\*\* (Jaeger) helps to understand pipeline execution.



This lab serves as a \*\*conceptual foundation\*\* for later assignments, where GPU acceleration and performance monitoring will be added.



\---



\## Learning Objectives



After completing this lab, you should be able to:



\* Explain why \*\*queues are used in cybersecurity systems\*\* (SIEM, SOC pipelines).

\* Design a \*\*multi-stage event-driven pipeline\*\* using Kafka.

\* Separate \*\*data generation\*\*, \*\*processing\*\*, and \*\*analysis\*\* stages.

\* Understand the role of \*\*distributed tracing\*\* in complex pipelines.

\* Map network events to \*\*MITRE ATT\&CK tactics and techniques\*\*.

\* Reason about \*\*throughput, latency, and decoupling\*\* in high-load systems.



\---



\## Conceptual Architecture



The pipeline you will work with has the following structure:



```

\[ Data Generator ]

&#x20;       |

&#x20;       v

&#x20;    Kafka

&#x20;       |

&#x20;       v

\[ Packet Classifier ]

&#x20;       |

&#x20;       v

&#x20; Local Storage (CSV)

&#x20;       |

&#x20;       v

\[ Statistics \& Analysis ]

```



In parallel, \*\*Jaeger\*\* is used to trace how data flows through the pipeline.



Important distinction:



\* \*\*Kafka + Redpanda Console\*\* → show \*what data flows\*

\* \*\*Jaeger\*\* → shows \*how the pipeline executes\*



\---



\## Scenario



You are building a \*\*toy cybersecurity analytics pipeline\*\* that classifies network-like events according to the \*\*MITRE ATT\&CK framework\*\*.



Each event represents a simplified “packet” or security-relevant activity (e.g., suspicious connection, authentication anomaly, scanning behavior).



The system must:



1\. Ingest events asynchronously.

2\. Process and classify them independently.

3\. Store results for later analysis.

4\. Provide visibility into pipeline execution.



This architecture mirrors real-world SOC / SIEM systems, only at a smaller and more understandable scale.



\---



\## Tools and Technologies



This lab uses the following components:



\* \*\*Docker Compose\*\* — to run the full pipeline

\* \*\*Kafka (KRaft mode)\*\* — message queue

\* \*\*Redpanda Console\*\* — Kafka event viewer

\* \*\*Jaeger\*\* — distributed tracing UI

\* \*\*JupyterLab\*\* — development and execution environment

\* \*\*Python\*\* — pipeline logic

\* \*\*CSV files\*\* — persistent storage (for simplicity)



> We intentionally use CSV files instead of databases to keep the focus on \*\*pipeline design\*\*, not database administration.

\* All notebooks are stored in a \*\*local volume\*\* mounted into JupyterLab.

\* All intermediate and final results are stored locally.

\## Pipeline Stages



\### 1. Data Producer (`Producer.ipynb`)



Responsibilities:



\* Read or generate synthetic network / packet-like events.

\* Assign unique event IDs.

\* Send events to a Kafka topic (e.g. `events.raw`).



Key idea:



> The producer \*\*does not know\*\* who will process the data.



\---



\### 2. Consumer \& Classifier (`Consumer\_Classifier.ipynb`)



Responsibilities:



\* Consume events from Kafka.

\* Perform lightweight classification.

\* Map events to \*\*MITRE ATT\&CK tactics / techniques\*\*.

\* Emit traces to \*\*Jaeger\*\*.

\* Save classification results to a local CSV file.



Key idea:



> The consumer works \*\*independently\*\* of the producer and can be scaled or replaced.



\---



\### 3. Statistics \& Analysis (`Statistics.ipynb`)



Responsibilities:



\* Load processed results from CSV.

\* Compute basic statistics:



&#x20; \* class distribution,

&#x20; \* frequency of MITRE tactics,

&#x20; \* processing counts.

\* Visualize results using simple plots.



Key idea:



> Analysis happens \*\*after\*\* the pipeline, not inside it.



\---



\## Tracing with Jaeger



Each processed batch or event should generate \*\*Jaeger spans\*\*, for example:



\* `kafka.consume`

\* `classification`

\* `storage.write`



Using Jaeger, you should be able to:



\* See the \*\*order of pipeline stages\*\*.

\* Observe \*\*latency per stage\*\*.

\* Understand how a single event moves through the system.



Jaeger UI is available at:



```

http://localhost:16686

```



\---



\## Kafka Event Inspection



Kafka topics and messages can be inspected using \*\*Redpanda Console\*\*:



```

http://localhost:8080

```



You are encouraged to:



\* Inspect raw events.

\* Inspect classified events (if you use a second topic).

\* Compare Kafka messages with stored CSV data.



\---



\## Assignment Tasks



\### Mandatory Tasks



1\. Run the full pipeline using `docker compose`.

2\. Generate and publish events to Kafka.

3\. Consume and classify events.

4\. Store classification results locally.

5\. Visualize basic statistics.

6\. Inspect:



&#x20;  \* Kafka topics in Redpanda Console,

&#x20;  \* traces in Jaeger.



\---



\### Conceptual Questions (to be answered in the report)



\* Why is Kafka used instead of direct function calls?

\* What happens if the consumer is slower than the producer?

\* How does tracing help debug pipeline behavior?

\* Which pipeline stages could be scaled independently?

\* How would this pipeline change in a real SOC system?



\---



\## Notes and Constraints



\* This lab \*\*does not require GPU acceleration\*\*.

\* Model quality is \*\*not graded\*\*.

\* Focus on \*\*architecture and reasoning\*\*, not ML performance.

\* Code clarity and pipeline correctness matter more than optimization.



\---



\## What Comes Next



In the next lab, this pipeline will be extended with:



\* GPU-accelerated data processing (cuDF),

\* accelerated model inference,

\* performance metrics and monitoring,

\* throughput and latency analysis.



\---



\## Key Takeaway



> \*\*In cybersecurity, pipelines matter more than models.\*\*

> This lab teaches you how such pipelines are built, observed, and reasoned about.
